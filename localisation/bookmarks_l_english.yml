 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 KAZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the russians retreated from Central Asia as the Dark Month raged on, Iran tried moving its armies in, attempting to make itself a world power. However, as it reached Kazakhstan, a cultist raider empire encountered it and devastated Iran's armies, eventually conquering Iran itself. \n\ They believed in Tengrism and modeled themselves after the Göktürks. Barely anyone outside of Tengri's Empire knows who controls the vast empire, all they know is that they are fighitng against them."
